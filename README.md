# 🧠 Daily DSA Challenge – Vishnu's Coding Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Challenge**!  
This repository is dedicated to strengthening my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** skills by solving problems every day.

---

## 📅 Challenge Rules

- ✅ I will **solve at least 1 DSA problem every day**.
- ❌ If I miss a day, I will **make up by solving 5–10 problems the next day**.
- 📈 Each solution includes:
  - Clean, well-commented code
  - Optimal **Time & Space Complexity**
  - Problem link (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
  - Brief explanation (if needed)
